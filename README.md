# Jobcoin

This repo is a small collection of starter templates for the Jobcoin Mixer programming challenge. There are three different versions provided for you to choose: Scala, Python, and NodeJS. It's perfectly okay to use another language you feel more comfortable writing in and simply use these examples as a loose guide.

All the implementations provided are roughly identical in what they provide to you:
 * a basic CLI app that accepts return addresses and gives back a deposit address to send funds to
 * a recommended library to use for Jobcoin API calls
 * a recommended library to use for tests
 
The mixing algorithm and any other changes are left for you to implement.
